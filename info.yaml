  author:       "Your Name"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Minimal 8-bit RISC-V processor with basic ALU operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, etc.) designed for area-constrained applications"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     10000000       # Clock frequency in Hz - 10MHz for simple operations
  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_tiny_riscv"
  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
